eSIM Mailer is a cross-platform desktop application designed to simplify the process of sending eSIM activation details via email. It supports both Gmail and Outlook email providers and offers a user-friendly interface for composing and sending emails with eSIM QR codes.

## Why eSIM Mailer? ü§î

Distributing eSIM activation details can be a repetitive and time-consuming task, especially when dealing with a large number of eSIMs. eSIM Mailer streamlines this process by:

1. üñ•Ô∏è Providing a simple interface to input email and eSIM details
2. üìß Supporting multiple email providers (Gmail and Outlook)
3. üñºÔ∏è Allowing attachment of eSIM QR code images
4. üîí Handling OAuth2 authentication securely
5. üëÄ Offering a preview of the email before sending

## The Story Behind eSIM Mailer üçâ

eSIM Mailer was born from a desire to expedite the process of sending eSIMs via [Connecting Humanity](https://connecting-humanity.org/), an initiative that connects Gazans with their families and the rest of the world. The repetitive nature of writing an email for each eSIM, typing out all the details every time, felt like a task ripe for automation. Recognizing that anything repetitive is easy to automate, this project was created to simplify and speed up the process of distributing eSIMs to Gazans. üçâüåç‚ù§Ô∏è
